# print(not True)#False ,NOT operator is opposite the condition means that if the value is true return false.if condition false than return true.

# print(not (a==b)) #True
# print(a==b and a!=b) #false that means if the both condition is true than return true,else any one condition is true and second one is false than also return false.
# print(a!=b or a==b)# true that means if the both of condition is true than return true else the first condition is true and second one is false than also return true.
